# SOLID Principles

This repository is created to understand the SOLID Design principles through hands-on code.

### WHO
* Introduced by Robert Martin(Uncle Bob) and named by Michael Feathers

### WHY
* To make the code easier to maintain
* To make the code easier to read and understand. Spend less time to figure out what it does and more time actually developing the solution.
* To make the code easier to quickly extend the system without breaking the existing ones. 

### HOW
* **S - Single Responsibility Principle**
  * A class should have one, and **only one**, **reason to change**
  * A class should only be **responsible for one thing**
  

* **O - Open Close Principle**
  * An entity should be **open** for **extension**, but **closed** for **modification**
  * Extend the functionality by adding new code instead of changing the existing code
  * _**how**_ - separate the behaviors so the system can easily be extended but never broken
  * **_goal_** - get to a point where you can never break the code of your system


* **L - Liskov Substitution Principle**


* **I - Interface Segregation Principle**


* **D - Dependency Inversion Principle**
